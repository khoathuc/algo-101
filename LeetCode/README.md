# Strategy

## 1. Start with top 100 liked question
    - Avoid hard question
    - Start with 50 easy and medium question first
## 2. Focus on topic
    - Never solve random question
    - Try to relize the pattern
    - Should relize the pattern after 20 questions with same topic
## 3. Order question from lowest to highest ACCEPTANCE RATE
    - Leet code difficulty level is subjective
    - Higher acceptance => easier
## 4. Learn from the solution
    - After stucking in 45 minutes
    - Learn solution
